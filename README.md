# Movie-Recommender
HarvardX Data Science Certificate Project

This is the first project from the capstone course on Edx.org.

The project was explore the MovieLens 10M dataset, build a recommender system and create a report describing the project. 

Project Instructions:
The submission for the MovieLens project will be three files: a report in the form of an Rmd file, a report in the form of a PDF document knit from your Rmd file, and an R script that generates your predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE.  The report documents the analysis and presents the findings, along with supporting statistics and figures. The report should be written assuming that the reader is not familiar with the project or the data. The report must include the RMSE generated.
